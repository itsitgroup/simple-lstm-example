# LSTM Text Classification - A Simple LSTM Example

This project implements a text classification model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.

## Project Structure

- `libraries.py`: Contains the import statements for required libraries.
- `preprocessing.py`: Includes data loading and preprocessing steps.
- `model.py`: Defines the LSTM model architecture.
- `train.py`: Contains the code for training the model.
- `evaluate.py`: Evaluates the trained model on the test data.

## How to Run

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the preprocessing script to prepare the data:
   ```bash
   python preprocessing.py
   ```

3. Define and compile the model:
   ```bash
   python model.py
   ```

4. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

5. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

## Requirements

The project dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
